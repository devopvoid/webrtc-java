/**
 * Allows an application access to information about the ICE transport over
 * which packets are sent and received. In particular, ICE manages peer-to-peer
 * connections which involve state which the application may want to access.
 * RTCIceTransport objects are constructed as a result of calls to {@link
 * RTCPeerConnection#setLocalDescription setLocalDescription} and {@link
 * RTCPeerConnection#setRemoteDescription setRemoteDescription}. Each
 * RTCIceTransport object represents the ICE transport layer for the RTP or RTCP
 * component of a specific {@link RTCRtpTransceiver}, or a group of
 * RTCRtpTransceivers if such a group has been negotiated via [BUNDLE].
