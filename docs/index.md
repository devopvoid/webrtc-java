  - title: Audio and video streaming
    details: Audio and video capture from cameras and microphones devices, with support for custom media sources for flexible streaming solutions.
  - title: Screen Sharing
    details: Share application windows or the full desktop with minimal setup; integrate screen capture streams like any other media stream.
  - title: Data Channels
    details: Reliable and unordered/ordered SCTP data channels for arbitrary messaging, file transfer, and app signaling.
  - title: Statistics API for monitoring
    details: Access WebRTC stats (bitrate, packet loss, jitter, RTT, frame rate, CPU) to monitor and optimize media quality.
