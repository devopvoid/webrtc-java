# Introduction

webrtc-java is a Java wrapper for the [WebRTC Native API](https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/native-code/native-apis), providing similar functionality to the [W3C JavaScript API](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc). It allows Java developers to build real-time communication applications for desktop platforms without having to work directly with native code.

The library provides a comprehensive set of Java classes that map to the WebRTC C++ API, making it possible to establish peer-to-peer connections, transmit audio and video, share screens, and exchange arbitrary data between applications.
